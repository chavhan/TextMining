  I am a loyal prime user of Amazon and shop frequently. Never have been disspointed with the delivery and if at all I was not happy with the product, support team of amazon would always help me out.So this time too the delivery was smooth and on schedule.The Sony service center team did call us but I had already installed the TV by myself as it was pretty simple. Service center team came to our house and delivered the wall mount panel and also they informed that they will do free mounting . I didn't require the mounting at that time.Finally about the product.Display, viewing angles and Sound quality is good. But would suggest people to get a good soundbar for good cinematic experience. (always recommended for any TV).The TV comes with smart features. It has dedicated YouTube and Netflix button on the remote. It has apps like prime, zee, yupp, Eros now, etc. I want to install Hotstar app but not sure if it is possible.The only issue is the smart tv interface is too laggy. I guess the RAM is not sufficient enough. Other than that playback happens super smooth which depends on a good wifi connection.So for a 43\ TV 38k is a bit high considering Chinese competitors like one plus giving at a much cheaper cost. But I paid a premium for a non Chinese company, Sony, which is also a made in India product and I have not qualms about it.Update: one cannot install additional apps on any \Smart TV\. It has to be an \Android TV\ for any new application installation
  Apart from the delay in installation. I must say Sony don’t make any compromise in quality. Classy Product and Excellent Picture quality. No buffer while streaming with normal internet speed.Can be viewed from any angle . Proud  buyer!!!
  Awesome clearity and picture quality...but need HD source to experience it
  Very angry custoner. Sony made a fool out of me .Written this is smart TV - it does not have app store . Basic feature of any smart device .I bought this TV by mistake , never buy this
  Very good product
  Bad product and worst service. Power adapter failed 2 days after installation. Complain was addressed after 5 days, but service centre (local) guys tried to replace the original adapter with lower rating and when i refused to accept it they thretened to close the service request without any solution. 11 days has passed since the complain was made, no solution till now.
  I have used the TV for one month and here is my review.Picture quality : 2.5/5, Do not expect much because of sony brand, I would say you get same feel when compared to TCL Tv. The picture quality is good, when there is low lighting in the house even tho you increase backlight of TV.Sound: Average 2/3 clarity will be but you have to keep minimum 50-60/100.Internet connectivity is good. Pre-installed apps runs smoothly can't install new apps and you cannot even use them browser.We browser is very slow even with good internet speed it takes more than 5 seconds lo load for each pageBuild quality I'm not sure about interior but exterior looks like a normal cheap TV.Overal 2.8/5
  If you want an awesome picture clarity and a TV which lasts long unlike other brands, just go for it !! Sound clarity is very good, however don't expect a home theatre like experience with surround sound and thumping bass. It is adequately loud and clear, which is good enough for most people.I would like to point out 2 things though:1. The TV doesn't support 5 GHz band. It only supports 2.4 GHz, which MIGHT cause some buffering issues while using the inbuilt OTT apps on TV.  However, while testing out apps on TV  (2.4 Ghz band), I did not have any issue.  It might be because my Wifi router (with 300 Mbps speed) is kept right below the TV. However, you can feel the issue of slowness at 2.4 GHz, when you start using the pre-installed browser on TV to open 'Hotstar'. (Yes, Hotstar doesn't come with the TV and nor can you install the app).I am anyways using Amazon Fire TV stick which supports 5 GHz band. If you are planning to use one too, you shouldn't worry at all.2. It is very difficult to insert USB drives/ HDMI cables once the TV has been wall mounted. Personally, I did not like this, but most people can live with it.
  Picture Quality : AwesomeSmart Features : GreatSound : Not up to the mark. Open baffle speakers give good clarity but no bass and surround.Service : Great. I had to contact Sony myself to get it installed. But Sony response was as always great.If u are a sound hound  :) go for another model with subwoofer inbuilt.

   I am using this Sony T.V. for 1 month and it is a good package of amazing picture and sound. The OS is not android based but never felt it's performance is lacking in anyways. The screen mirroring with phone and laptop works very smoothly. Built in apps - Netflix, Prime Videos, Youtube, Sony Liv, Zee5, Eros now, Big flix, Alt Balaji, Voot, Hungama Play.Also, inbuilt browser and FM radio available.I think only bass level is less. Otherwise sound is very clear and lound and definetly best picture quality due to Sony Bravia engine.I use the SD set top box still the clarity of the picture is amazing.
